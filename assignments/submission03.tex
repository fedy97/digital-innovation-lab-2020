    \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
    In the context of safety of people, the Protezione Civile authority occupies the role of city security guarantor.
    We selected two members of this organization and detailed their activities with the purpose of defining the functional requirements of the solution we are proposing.
    The subjects are distinguished by a different seniority level and by roles that include activities performed with different levels of abstraction.
    The primary persona, identified by Giulio Fumagalli, covers the role of supervisor agent in the operative centre of the Italian Civil Protection of Milan.
    His operational tasks are the starting point for our analysis of the reference context because satisfying his need implies bringing added value also to his operating chief.
